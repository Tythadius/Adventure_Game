To run this program you need to have a python application to run this. Simply download PyCharm from the internet, download the files here, and give a go. 

The Main file is what you will run. The Inventory file is a supporting file with all of your inventory in it. 

The other document is just the rules that I followed so if you want to read that you can.

After the program has run. There will be two files in your computer that you can delete if you wnat to. They are just files that are created by using python code. The two files should be in your python folder and one in your documents folder. 

Have fun.
