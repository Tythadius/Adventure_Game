To run this program you need to have a pythin application to run this. Simply download PyCharm from the internet and give a go. 

The Main file is what you will run. The Inventory file is a supporting file with all of your inventory in it. 

The other document is just the rules that I followed so if you want to read that you can.

Have fun.
